### Owlang <img src="docs/assets/owlang_icon.svg" alt="Owlang" width="20" align="center"/>

</div>

Owlang is a new programming language designed to be simpler than Python, yet as powerful as Rust.
This repository contains the compiler (`owc`), package manager (`owm`), and developer tooling (formatter, linter, LSP).

The language features a clean and intuitive syntax, allowing users to focus on problem-solving rather than getting bogged down by complex language rules. With a strong emphasis on educational use, OwLang provides a gentle introduction to programming while still being powerful enough for more advanced projects.

> ⚠️ Experimental — Owlang is in active early development.
>
> Owlang is in its early experimental phase. Expect rapid iterations and breaking changes.
